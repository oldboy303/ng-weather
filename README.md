# ng-weather

Basic Angular weather app with a a custom service and directive. Using *ngRoute* for routing and *ngResource* for the API call to *[apixu.com](apixu.com)*. The apixu key is dead (of course), but you can sign up for a key yourself and then just replace the url in the $resource call in the weather_service.js file with the url you're given by apixu after you sign up.
